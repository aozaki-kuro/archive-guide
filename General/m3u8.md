## 🔨 Tool Prepartion

- youtube-dl - general purpose video downloader [[Github](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)]
- ffmpeg [[Github](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)] [[Guide Here](http://blog.gregzaal.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/)]
- Get cookies.txt [[Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt/bgaddhkoddajcdgocldbbfleckgcbcid)]

## 🎪 Environment Setup

First, you have to have youtube-dl set up on your system. Check the [Windows ver Guide](YouTube.md) for details on how to set up.

Alternatively, you can use the Easy Scripts provided [here](/scripts).

Or if you're really lazy, you can click and drag youtube-dl.exe into your command console to use it too:

![cmd drag](https://github.com/aozaki-kuro/archive-guide/blob/main/assets/clickdrag.PNG)

Next, you will need the ` Get cookies.txt` extension for your browser.

## 📝 Extract the `.m3u8` link

After entering the streaming page, press F12 on your keyboard to bring up the developer console for your browser. Click on the "Network" tab on the top.

In the "Filter URLs" section, type in `m3u8`, then **refresh the page**. You should see the main `.m3u8` link generated.

If the default resolution isn't 1080p don't worry, keep the developer console open and select 1080p manually and you should be able to see the main `.m3u8` link generate.

Right click the .m3u8 link, and select Copy > Copy URL. **This is the URL to the actual video source, so make sure you write it down somewhere**

## 🍪 Grab `cookies.txt`

Make sure you have the `Get cookies.txt` extension installed on your browser (link above). Now click on the plugin icon, and select "Current Site." You can save the `cookies.txt` file anywhere you like

## 💾 Download

Now that you have the `.m3u8` link and the `cookies.txt`, we are ready to use `youtube-dl` to download the video. 

Use this template to download the video. Replace the stuff in `""` with the appropriate content you got from earlier

```powershell
youtube-dl "the .m3u8 link" --cookies "path to cookies.txt" -o "path to where you want to save the video"
```

You can drag `youtube-dl.exe` and the `cookies.txt` file to your cmd to get the exact path easy

![cmd drag](/assets/clickdrag.PNG)

Your command should look something like this

Now press enter and the download should start. Wait a bit and you should see the video in the path you specified above.

If you can't find the video, chances are it's probably in whatever folder this says

![cmddefault](/assets/cmddefault.PNG)

Alternatively, if you choose to use the Easy Scripts [here](/scripts), you can just have cookies.txt be in the same folder as the scripts and `youtube-dl.exe`. Just paste in the `.m3u8` link when asked by the script.

## 🎯 Troubleshooting

If you are following the [YouTube guide](/General/YouTube.md) and enabled `aria2`, you might get an error message from `youtube-dl`. You should disable the `--external-downloader` option before downloading.

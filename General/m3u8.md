## 🔨 Tool Prepartion

- youtube-dl - general purpose video downloader [[Github](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)]
- ffmpeg [[Github](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)] [[Guide Here](http://blog.gregzaal.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/)]
- Get cookies.txt [[Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt/bgaddhkoddajcdgocldbbfleckgcbcid)]

## 🎪 Environment Setup

First, you have to have youtube-dl set up on your system. Check the [Windows ver Guide](YouTube.md) for details on how to set up.

Alternatively, you can use the Easy Scripts provided [here](/scripts).

Or if you're really lazy, you can click and drag `youtube-dl.exe` into your command console to use it too:

![cmd drag](/assets/clickdrag.PNG)

Next, you will need the ` Get cookies.txt` extension for your browser.

## 📝 Extract the `.m3u8` link

![step](/assets/search.jpg)

After entering the streaming page, press F12 on your keyboard to bring up the developer console for your browser. Click on the "Network" tab on the top (the <b><font color="red">RED</font></b> arrow).

In the "Filter URLs" section, type in `m3u8`, then **refresh the page**. You should see the main `.m3u8` link generated (the <b><font color="green">GREEN</font></b> arrow).

If the default resolution isn't 1080p don't worry, keep the developer console open and select 1080p manually and you should be able to see the main `.m3u8` link generate.

Right click the .m3u8 link (the <b><font color="blue">BLUE</font></b> arrow), and select Copy > Copy URL. **This is the URL to the actual video source, so make sure you write it down somewhere**

Be careful the actual extracted link should look like `cam_v1_.m3u8`, or it might not contain audio.

## 🍪 Grab `cookies.txt`

![cookies](/assets/cookiestxt.jpg)

Make sure you have the `Get cookies.txt` extension installed on your browser (link above). Now click on the plugin icon, and click `Export` . You can save the `cookies.txt` file anywhere you like.

## 💾 Download

Now that you have the `.m3u8` link and the `cookies.txt`, we are ready to use `youtube-dl` to download the video. 

Use this template to download the video. Replace the stuff in `""` with the appropriate content you got from earlier

```bash
youtube-dl "the .m3u8 link" --cookies "path to cookies.txt" -o "path to where you want to save the video"
```

Your command should look something like this

![downloadlink](/assets/downloadlink.jpg)

Now press enter and the download should start. Wait a bit and you should see the video in the path you specified above.

Alternatively, if you choose to use the Easy Scripts [here](/scripts), you can just have `cookies.txt` file be in the same folder as the scripts and `youtube-dl.exe`. Just paste in the `.m3u8` link when asked by the script.

## 🎥 Format Selecting

The naming rule of SPWN's `.m3u8` video and audio isn't the same as YouTube, so the `best` or `bestaudio+bestvideo` doesn't always work with SPWN and other sites.

I suggest using `-F` to make sure the format we are going to download first.

![format](/assets/format.jpg)

As shown above, there are different formats available. Since we are going to archive the best format so what we need is `5279` (best) and `program_audio-Fine`.

Then type

```bash
youtube-dl -f 5279+program_audio-Fine ".m3u8 address"
```

We shall have the best video and audio downloaded.

## 🎯 Troubleshooting

If you are following the [YouTube guide](/General/YouTube.md) and enabled `aria2`, you might get an error message from `youtube-dl`. You should disable the `--external-downloader` option before downloading.
